    "\n",
    "This concept was initially designed by OpenAI ---> Handoff Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Swarm implements a team in which agent can handoff task to another agent based on their capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a group chat where agents take turn to generate a response, participant agents broadcast their response so all the agents share the same message context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this, next agent is selected based on the most recent HandofMessage message in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `AssistantAgent` we can set the handoffs arguments to specify which agents it can handoff to. This will only work if a swarm is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall process is:\n",
    "1. Each agent can generate a HandoffMessage to indicate which agents it can hand off to.\n",
    "2. The initial agent(s) begin the task and decide locally whether to hand off and to whom.\n",
    "3. When a HandoffMessage is generated, the designated agent takes over with the same context.\n",
    "4. This process repeats until a termination condition is reached.\n",

    "## Travel Refund Teams Workflow\n",
    "1. Travel Agent initiates the conversation and try to understand the user's request.\n",
    "2. Based on the request:\n",
    "    - For generic info, it gives that and would ideally handoff to user.\n",
    "    - For refund related requests, Agent handoff to the Flight refunder.\n",
    "3. Flight refunder uses the tool **refund_flight** tool when required.\n",
    "4. If agent hands off to **user**, team execution will stop and wait for user's response.\n",
    "5. If user provides an input, it is sent back to team as a Handoff Message and **is directed to the agent that originally reuested users input**.\n",
    "6. This process will continue until Travel agent determines the task is complete and terminate the workflow."
